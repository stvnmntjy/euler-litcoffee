####<u>Problem 2</u>

#####Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<pre>
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
</pre>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    define ['underscore'], (_) ->
      solve: ->
        gen = (arr) ->
          if not arr or arr.length is 0
          then gen [0, 1]
          else if _.last(arr) > 4000000
          then _.initial arr
          else gen arr.concat [_.last(arr) + _.last _.initial arr]
        _.reduce (_.filter gen(), (a) -> a % 2 is 0),
                 ((m, a) -> m + a),
                 0
